## SUCCESS METRICS
The research should provide enough technical detail to:
1. Recreate authentic hardcore synth sounds from scratch
2. Program realistic MIDI patterns with proper groove and dynamics  
3. Build accurate audio processing chains
4. Identify and acquire the right tools (VST plugins/hardware)
5. Understand the sonic characteristics that define each subgenre

## FOCUS PRIORITY
1. **Technical specificity over general descriptions**
2. **Numerical values and measurable parameters**  
3. **Workflow and signal chain documentation**
4. **Tool identification and alternatives**
5. **Authentic vintage hardware characteristics**

This research will inform either VST3 integration for accessing authentic preset libraries, or enhanced pure Python synthesis algorithms that recreate these characteristics programmatically.
