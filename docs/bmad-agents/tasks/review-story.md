```

#### Music-Specific Testing:

**Audio Quality:**
```python
# Test audio output for:

- Correct BPM and timing
```

**MIDI Validation:**
```python
# Verify MIDI data:
- Note values in range (0-127)
- Timing accurate to grid

- Pattern structure correct
```

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Validation

For each criterion in story:
- [ ] Criterion met completely
- [ ] Measurable and verifiable
- [ ] Tested appropriately
- [ ] Edge cases considered

### 5. Regression Testing

#### Run Full Suite:
```bash
# Execute complete test suite
pytest tests/ --run-slow

# Ensure:
- [ ] No existing functionality broken
- [ ] All previous tests still pass
- [ ] Performance not degraded
```

#### Manual Testing:
For Phase-specific features:

**Phase 1 (Prototyper):**
```bash
python main.py "create 180 BPM hardcore kick pattern"
# Verify WAV file generated with correct pattern
```

**Phase 2 (Instrument):**
```python
# Test TUI responsiveness
# Verify multi-track mixing
# Check real-time playback
```

**Phase 3 (Partner):**
```python
# Test groove application
# Verify MIDI hardware response
# Check user preference learning
```

**Phase 4 (Studio):**
```python
# Test arrangement timeline
# Verify VST loading
# Check stem export quality
```

### 6. Quality Assessment

#### Code Metrics:
```python
# Analyze:
- Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- Function length < 50 lines
- Class cohesion high
- Coupling low
```

#### Documentation:
- [ ] All public functions documented
- [ ] Complex logic explained
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] API changes documented

#### Security:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] No SQL injection risks
- [ ] File operations safe
