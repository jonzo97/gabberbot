  business_value: |
    Elevates the system to professional-grade synthesis capable of industry-standard
    hardcore production. Users get access to authentic TR-909 analog modeling,
    Alpha Juno hoover synthesis, and advanced FM algorithms for release-quality audio.
    
    User Impact: "create authentic gabber kick" → TR-909 analog circuit modeling
    "generate Rotterdam hoover lead" → Alpha Juno PWM and chorus synthesis
    This transforms the system into a complete professional synthesis workstation.
