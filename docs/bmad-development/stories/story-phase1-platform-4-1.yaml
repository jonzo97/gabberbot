context:
  business_value: |
    Transforms the system from standalone tool into professional production
    pipeline integrated with industry-standard DAWs. Users can seamlessly
    export patterns, stems, and complete tracks to Ableton Live, Logic Pro,
    and other professional production environments.
    
    User Impact: "export to Ableton Live with separated stems" → professional workflow
    "create Logic Pro project with MIDI and audio stems" → complete integration
    This bridges AI-generated hardcore content with professional mixing/mastering.
    
    From Epic 4: DAW export integration for professional production pipeline
    Creates the ExportService for comprehensive DAW compatibility.
    
  epic_relationship: |
    Story 4.1 begins Epic 4's platform integration focus by creating professional
