context:
  business_value: |
    Elevates the system from basic synthesis to professional production quality.
    Users get access to authentic hardcore effects chains that match industry
    standards for gabber, industrial, and uptempo production.
    
    User Impact: "add warehouse reverb" → professional industrial atmosphere
    "apply Rotterdam distortion" → authentic gabber kick processing
    This transforms hobby-level output into release-ready professional audio.
    
    From Epic 2: Professional effects processing with authentic hardcore chains
    Creates the EffectsService for industry-standard audio enhancement.
    
  epic_relationship: |
    Story 2.2 builds on 2.1's pattern evolution by adding professional audio
    processing. Works with Story 2.3 hardware integration for real-time control
    and prepares foundation for Story 2.4's advanced synthesis engine.
    
  current_state: |
    Epic 1 completed basic audio synthesis and Story 2.1 added pattern evolution.
    Repository has working MIDIClip generation, AudioService rendering, and
    EvolutionService. Need professional effects processing to match industry
    quality for hardcore electronic music production.

requirements:
  functional: |
    Professional Effects Processing:
    - EffectsService with authentic hardcore effects chains
    - Industry-standard presets: ANGERFIST, HOOVER, WAREHOUSE from CLAUDE.md
    - Real-time parameter automation and modulation
    - Effects chain sequencing and parallel processing
    - Professional mastering chain with proper limiting
    
    Hardcore-Specific Processing:
    - TR-909 kick distortion chains (doorlussen technique)
    - Alpha Juno hoover processing with chorus and filter resonance
    - Industrial reverb rumble creation with 3-layer architecture
    - Sidechain compression for authentic hardcore pumping
    - Spectral processing for "warmth" vs "coldness" control
    
  non_functional:
    performance: Real-time effects processing <50ms latency
    quality: Professional-grade effects matching hardware units
    reliability: Stable processing without audio artifacts
    usability: Intuitive preset system with parameter control
    
architecture:
  patterns: |
    From CLAUDE.md Pedalboard Effect Presets:
    - Use existing ANGERFIST, HOOVER, WAREHOUSE preset implementations
    - EffectsService implementing clean effects chain architecture
    - Professional Track-based design: Audio Source → FX Chain → Mixer
    - Leverage existing AbstractSynthesizer interface patterns
    
    From Hardcore Production Knowledge:
    - Rotterdam gabber distortion chains with mixer overdrive
    - Industrial 3-layer kick architecture (main + rumble + ghost)
    - Authentic analog modeling for TR-909 and Alpha Juno processing
    - Professional mastering with proper limiting and compression

      - Existing Pedalboard presets from CLAUDE.md
      - AudioService from Story 3 for effects integration
      - EvolutionService from Story 2.1 for parameter evolution
    
  constraints: |
    - Effects must maintain hardcore aesthetic and aggressive character
    - Professional audio quality suitable for mastering and release
    - Real-time parameter control for live performance capability
