context:
  business_value: |
    Transforms the system into a true "jamming partner" with sophisticated
    natural language understanding for hardcore music production. Users can
    have nuanced conversations about musical style, evolution, and production
    techniques using professional terminology and slang.
    
    User Impact: "make it sound more like Angerfist's Rotterdam style" → style transfer
    "add some of that warehouse atmosphere from the 90s" → contextual understanding
    This creates the promised "ChatOps for music production" conversational experience.
    
    From Epic 3: Advanced conversational AI with hardcore music intelligence
    Creates the ConversationService for sophisticated music production dialogue.
    
  epic_relationship: |
    Story 3.1 begins Epic 3's focus on user experience by creating advanced
    conversational AI. Works with Stories 3.2-3.3 for pattern library and
    terminal interface to create a complete user-centric production environment.
    
  current_state: |
    Epic 2 completed advanced production capabilities with professional synthesis.
    Repository has working AdvancedSynthesisService, EvolutionService, EffectsService,
