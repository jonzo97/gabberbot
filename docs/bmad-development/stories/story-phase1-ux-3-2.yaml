context:
  business_value: |
    Transforms the system from session-based to persistent professional workflow
    with comprehensive pattern library management. Users can build, save, and
    evolve a personal collection of hardcore patterns, presets, and production
    templates for ongoing music production projects.
    
    User Impact: "save this gabber pattern as 'Rotterdam Bass 1'" → persistent library
    "load my industrial kick collection" → instant access to personal sounds
    This creates a professional production environment with persistent workflow.
    
    From Epic 3: Pattern library system with save/load and organization capabilities
    Creates the LibraryService for comprehensive pattern management.
    
  epic_relationship: |
    Story 3.2 builds on 3.1's conversational AI by adding persistent pattern
    management. Works with Story 3.3's terminal interface to create a complete
    user-centric production environment with professional workflow continuity.
    
  current_state: |
    Story 3.1 completed advanced conversational AI with hardcore music intelligence.
    Repository has sophisticated ConversationService with all Epic 2 production
    capabilities. Need persistent pattern library system for professional workflow
    and long-term production project management.

architecture:
  patterns: |
    From CLAUDE.md Professional Architecture:
    - LibraryService implementing comprehensive pattern management
    - Database-backed persistence with proper indexing and search
    - Integration with existing MIDIClip architecture for compatibility
    - Version control system for pattern evolution tracking
    
    From Professional Production Workflow:
    - Project-based organization with template system
    - Metadata-rich pattern storage with hardcore-specific attributes
    - Collaborative sharing capabilities for pattern exchange
    - Backup and restore functionality for data protection
    
  components:
    new: 
      - src/services/library_service.py (pattern library management)
      - src/database/ (pattern storage and persistence)
      - src/library/ (organization, search, and metadata management)
      - src/templates/ (project templates and starter patterns)
      - src/export/ (pattern import/export and sharing)
      - tests/library/ (library functionality and data integrity testing)
    modify:
      - src/services/conversation_service.py (integrate library commands)
      - main.py (add library management interface)
    integrate:
      - ConversationService from Story 3.1 for natural language library control
      - All Epic 2 services for comprehensive pattern generation and processing
      - Existing MIDIClip architecture for pattern compatibility
    
  constraints: |
    - Library must preserve pattern quality and metadata integrity
    - Search functionality must be fast and intuitive for large collections
    - Version control must track evolution history without data bloat
    - Import/export must maintain compatibility across different systems
    - Backup system must ensure data protection and recovery capability
    
  existing_code:
    leverage: 
      - Existing MIDIClip architecture for pattern data structure
      - ConversationService for natural language library commands

      - Database persistence patterns from existing codebase
    avoid:
      - Complex database schemas that slow down pattern operations
      - Generic organization that doesn't match hardcore production workflow
    refactor:
      - Enhance existing pattern handling with persistent library capabilities
      - Extract reusable library components for different pattern types
