context:
  business_value: |
    Transforms the system from software-only into a complete hardware-integrated
    production environment. Users can control pattern generation, evolution, and
    effects processing through physical MIDI controllers for live performance.
    
    User Impact: Novation Launchpad triggers pattern variations in real-time
    MIDI Fighter 3D controls effects parameters with motion sensors
    This enables live hardcore performances and hands-on production workflow.
    
    From Epic 2: Hardware integration framework for production controllers
    Creates the HardwareService for MIDI controller integration.
    
  epic_relationship: |
    Story 2.3 builds on Stories 2.1-2.2 by adding hardware control for pattern
    evolution and effects processing. Prepares for Story 2.4's advanced synthesis
    with real-time parameter control from physical hardware.
    
  current_state: |
    Stories 2.1-2.2 completed pattern evolution and professional effects.
    Repository has working EvolutionService and EffectsService with parameter
    control. Need hardware integration framework for MIDI controllers to enable
    live performance and hands-on production workflow.

    From CLAUDE.md Hardware Integration:
    - HardwareService implementing MIDI controller abstraction
    - Device-specific mapping system for different controller types
    - Integration with existing EvolutionService and EffectsService
