context:
  business_value: |
    Completes the core MVP value proposition by enabling complete text-to-audio
    generation. Users can now run a single command and receive high-quality WAV
    files, proving the entire system concept works end-to-end.
    
    User Impact: "python main.py 'create 180 BPM gabber kick'" -> immediate WAV file
    This delivers the promised "ChatOps for music production" experience.
    
    From Epic 1: Technical Story 1.3 - Consolidate AI and Synthesis Logic
    Creates the final AudioService to complete the text → MIDI → audio pipeline.
    
  epic_relationship: |
    This story completes Epic 1 by implementing the AudioService component that
    renders MIDIClip objects (from Stories 1&2) into high-quality WAV files.
    It also creates the main.py orchestration script that ties everything together.
    
  current_state: |
    Repository now has:
    - Story 1: Complete MIDIClip data models and configuration system
    - Story 2: GenerationService for natural language → MIDIClip conversion
    - Existing audio synthesis capabilities in cli_strudel and cli_sc
    - Need to consolidate into single AudioService for WAV rendering

requirements:
  functional: |
    From Epic 1 Acceptance Criteria:
    - AudioService that takes MIDIClip objects and returns WAV files
    - main.py script orchestrating GenerationService + AudioService
    - Complete text-to-audio pipeline: "text prompt" → "output.wav"
    - High-quality synthesis matching hardcore/gabber aesthetic
    
    From User Story 1.1:
    - Command-line interface: python main.py "prompt"
    - Audible, musically coherent WAV output
    - Clear console feedback during generation
    - Output files saved to designated directory
    
  non_functional:
    performance: Total generation time <10 seconds for simple patterns
    quality: Professional-grade audio suitable for music production
    reliability: Consistent output quality across different pattern types
    usability: Single command execution with clear progress feedback
    
architecture:
  patterns: |
    From Epic Technical Story 1.3:
    - Single AudioService consolidating all synthesis logic
    - Clean separation: GenerationService → MIDIClip → AudioService → WAV
    - main.py as simple orchestrator between services
    - Leverage existing synthesis capabilities from cli_strudel/cli_sc
    
    From Architecture Spec:
    - Use existing AbstractSynthesizer interface for consistency
    - Hardcore-focused synthesis parameters from CLAUDE.md
    - Professional audio export with proper sample rates
    
  components:
    new: 
      - src/services/audio_service.py (MIDIClip → WAV rendering)
      - src/audio/ (audio synthesis modules)
      - main.py (command-line orchestration script)
      - tests/audio/ (audio quality testing)
    modify:
      - pyproject.toml (audio dependencies)
    integrate:
      - Existing cli_strudel synthesis capabilities
      - Existing cli_sc SuperCollider integration
    
  constraints: |
    - Must produce WAV files suitable for professional music production
    - Synthesis must match hardcore/gabber aesthetic (CRUNCHY KICKS)
    - Support standard sample rates (44.1kHz, 48kHz)
    - Audio export must be compatible with DAWs
    - Phase 1 constraint: Single-process, no background workers
    
  existing_code:
    leverage: 
      - cli_strudel synthesis library (FM, sidechain, effects)
      - cli_sc SuperCollider integration

      - Story 2 GenerationService integration
    avoid:
      - Multiple conflicting synthesis engines
      - Complex real-time audio processing (Phase 2 feature)
    refactor:
      - Consolidate synthesis logic into single AudioService
