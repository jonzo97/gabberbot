context:
  business_value: |
    Establishes the foundational engineering practices required for a maintainable,
    scalable music production system. This story implements the non-negotiable
    pillars (Poetry, Pydantic, testing) that all subsequent development depends on.
    
    User Impact: Enables reliable dependency management and type-safe data models
    that prevent common music production bugs (timing issues, note range errors).
    
    From PRD: Foundational Pillars section - Poetry for dependency management,
    Pydantic for configuration management, testing pyramid strategy.
    
  epic_relationship: |
    This story implements Epic Technical Story 1.2: "Establish foundational
    engineering pillars." It creates the stable foundation that Stories 2 and 3
    will build upon for AI integration and audio synthesis.
    
  current_state: |
    Repository has been cleaned up with basic src/ structure:
    - src/background/generation_worker.py (existing AI agent)
    - src/shared/clip_tools.py (utility functions)
    - No dependency management or data models currently exist

requirements:
  functional: |
    From PRD Section 1 - Core Music Generation:
    - MIDI Clip Architecture: Robust data model for MIDI clips with notes, velocity, timing
    - Pattern Generator Support: Data structures for acid basslines and kick patterns
    - Configuration Management: Type-safe settings and API key management
    
    From Epic Acceptance Criteria:
    - Poetry manages dependencies with reproducible virtual environment
    - Core data structures defined as Pydantic models
    - Environment variables/secrets properly loaded from .env
    - Basic unit test suite established and passing
    
  non_functional:
    performance: Fast model validation (<1ms for MIDI clip creation)
    reliability: Type safety prevents invalid MIDI data (notes 0-127, valid timing)
    usability: Clear model structure for other developers to understand
    
architecture:
  patterns: |
    From Architecture Spec Section 6.0 - Data Models:
    - Pydantic models for all core musical data (MIDIClip, Note, AutomationPoint)
    - Serialization-ready structures for future .hcs project files
    - Type-safe configuration classes
    
    From Architecture Spec Section 4.0 - Foundational Pillars:
    - Poetry for dependency management (reproducible environments)
    - Pydantic for configuration management (type-safe settings)
    - Testing pyramid: Unit -> Integration -> E2E
    
  components:
    new: 
      - pyproject.toml (Poetry configuration)
      - src/models/core.py (Pydantic data models)
      - src/models/config.py (Configuration classes)
      - src/utils/env.py (Environment loading)
      - tests/unit/test_models.py (Model tests)
    modify: []
    integrate: []
    
  constraints: |
    - Must support Python 3.11+ (async/await features needed for Phase 2)
    - MIDI note values must be constrained to 0-127 range
    - Timing values must be non-negative floats
    - All models must be JSON serializable for future persistence
