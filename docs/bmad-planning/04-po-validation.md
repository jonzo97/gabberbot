# BMAD Implementation Plan: Hardcore Music Production System

**Version:** 1.0 **Status:** Ready for Development **Author:** Sarah, Product Owner üìù

## 1.0 Overview

This document outlines the master plan for evolving the Hardcore Music Production System from its current state as a fragmented developer library into a complete, TUI-centric, AI-assisted music creation tool. The strategy is built on a phased approach that prioritizes immediate value delivery, foundational architecture, and systematic feature implementation.

This plan is the single source of truth for development sequencing and priorities. It synthesizes the goals from the **Project Brief (v2.0)**, the technical blueprint from the **Architecture Specification (v5.0)**, and the requirements from the **PRD (v1.2)**.

## 2.0 Core Strategy: Evolve Systematically

Our strategy is to build in four distinct, value-driven phases. Each phase delivers a more capable and complete product, ensuring that we always have a working, testable system.

-   **Current State:** A collection of working but disconnected MIDI generation scripts and experimental components.
    
-   **Future Vision:** A cohesive, real-time, TUI-based application that acts as an intelligent musical partner.
    

The path from current to future is as follows:

1.  **Phase 1: The Prototyper** - Leverage existing strengths to create a useful, standalone command-line tool.
    
2.  **Phase 2: The Instrument** - Build the foundational real-time architecture and interactive TUI.
    
3.  **Phase 3: The Partner** - Add musical intelligence, feel, and adaptability.
    
4.  **Phase 4: The Studio** - Deliver professional-grade arrangement and export capabilities.
    

## 3.0 Phased Development Roadmap

This roadmap links directly to the detailed Epic specifications for each phase.

Status

**Phase 1**

**The Prototyper**

Validate the core AI-to-audio concept in a simple, high-value tool.

Standalone CLI for text-to-`.wav` generation. Foundational engineering patterns (Poetry, Pydantic).

**Ready**

**Phase 2**

**The Instrument**

Build the real-time, interactive application framework.

TUI, multi-process architecture, SuperCollider integration, Undo/Redo.

Blocked by Phase 1

**Phase 3**

**The Partner**

Make the tool feel musically intelligent and responsive.

Scenes, Groove Engine, User Profile, MIDI hardware support.

Blocked by Phase 2

**Phase 4**

**The Studio**

Enable the creation of complete, professional-quality tracks.

Arrangement timeline, VST3 support, Stem/Master export.

Blocked by Phase 3

## 4.0 Component Strategy: Improve vs. Replace

To execute this plan, we will be ruthless in our focus.

-   **Components to Improve & Integrate:**
    
    -   `cli_shared/models/midi_clips.py` (The core data model)
        
    -   `cli_shared/generators/acid_bassline.py` (Proven pattern logic)
        
    -   `cli_shared/generators/tuned_kick.py` (Proven pattern logic)
        
    -   `intelligent_music_agent_v2.py` (The chosen AI agent to be consolidated)
        
-   **Components to Delete & Replace:**
    
    -   **ALL** other experimental AI agents (`intelligent_music_agent.py`, `master_music_agent.py`, etc.).
        
    -   **ALL** other experimental synthesis engines (`cli_sc/`, `cli_tidal/`, `audio/synthesis/`).
        
    -   **ALL** partial UI implementations (`cli_tui/`, `frontend/`).
        
    -   **ALL** abandoned code in `archive/`.
        
    -   These will be replaced by the components defined in the **Architecture Spec v5.0**.
