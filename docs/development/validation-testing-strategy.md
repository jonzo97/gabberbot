# Validation & Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.0 **Author:** Sarah, Product Owner 📝

## 1.0 Guiding Principle

Our testing strategy follows the standard testing pyramid. We will build a foundation of fast, reliable unit tests, supported by integration tests that verify component interactions, and capped by a small number of end-to-end tests that validate complete user journeys.

## 2.0 Quality Gates by Phase

Success for each phase is defined by specific, measurable criteria that combine technical quality with user value.

### **Phase 1: The Prototyper**

-   **Testing Focus:**
    
    -   **Unit Tests:** Rigorous testing of all `MIDIClip` and pattern generation logic. Target 90% coverage on these core modules.
        
    -   **Manual E2E:** Execute the main script with 20+ varied prompts to validate musical coherence and robustness.
        
-   **Success & Validation Criteria:**
    
    -   **Qualitative:** In a blind listening test, 3 out of 5 target users (Raveena persona) rate the generated audio files as "musically interesting" and "genre-appropriate."
        
    -   **Quantitative:** Successful audio generation for 95% of test prompts without crashing.
        
    -   **Technical:** All foundational pillars (Poetry, Pydantic) are implemented and core unit tests pass in a CI environment (GitHub Actions).
        

### **Phase 2: The Instrument**

-   **Testing Focus:**
    
    -   **Unit Tests:** Add tests for the `Main Controller` logic, including the Undo/Redo stack.
        
    -   **Integration Tests:**
        
        -   Verify the `Controller` -> `Generation Worker` IPC (job/result queues).
            
        -   Verify the `Controller` -> `AudioEngine` OSC messaging.
            
    -   **E2E Tests:** Basic automated tests for the TUI (e.g., app launches, play command triggers OSC messages).
        
-   **Success & Validation Criteria:**
    
    -   **Performance:** The real-time audio pipeline latency **shall** be < 20ms.
        
    -   **Reliability:** A crash in the `Generation Worker` **shall not** crash the main application.
        
    -   **Task Completion:** 80% of beta testers can successfully create and mix a 4-track loop without assistance.
        
    -   **Engagement:** Average user session time for beta testers exceeds 15 minutes.
        

### **Phase 3: The Partner**

-   **Testing Focus:**
    
    -   **Unit Tests:** Add tests for the `GrooveEngine` logic and Scene management.
        
    -   **Integration Tests:** Verify the `MIDI_IO` listener correctly generates OSC messages.
        
    -   **E2E Tests:** Add tests for creating and launching scenes.
        
-   **Success & Validation Criteria:**
    
    -   **Usability:** A/B testing shows users rate patterns with "Groove" applied as significantly better sounding.
        
    -   **Adoption:** 50% of beta testers with MIDI hardware successfully map and use a controller.
        
    -   **Intelligence:** The `UserProfile` correctly learns and suggests at least one user preference after 3 sessions.
        

### **Phase 4: The Studio**

-   **Testing Focus:**
    
    -   **Unit Tests:** Add tests for the Arrangement and Export logic.
        
    -   **Integration Tests:** Verify the application can correctly scan, list, and attempt to load VST3 plugins.
        
    -   **E2E Tests:** An automated test that builds a simple arrangement and validates that the exported stems are the correct length and number.
        
-   **Success & Validation Criteria:**
    
    -   **Task Completion:** A user can go from a single text prompt to a fully arranged, 1-minute track that can be exported as stems.
        
    -   **Integration:** Successful loading and audio routing of 5 popular commercial VST3 plugins (e.g., Serum, Valhalla Vintage Verb).
        
    -   **Data Integrity:** Exported stems align perfectly when imported into a commercial DAW.
