"""
Audio Engine Refactoring Success Test

Simple test to validate that our comprehensive refactoring is working:
- All engines are properly structured and importable
- Track system integration is maintained
- Engine router is functional  
- Frontend architecture is updated
- New features are accessible

This test focuses on architecture validation rather than runtime testing.
